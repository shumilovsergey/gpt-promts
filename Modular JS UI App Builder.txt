I'm building a simple frontend app. I want it to be built without frameworks (no React, Vue, etc.), just clean HTML + CSS + vanilla JS.

Please structure it with:

A minimal index.html (only core elements and containers)

Logic-heavy JavaScript, structured like a modular UI renderer (like React without React)

External style.css for all styles (no inline or embedded <style>)

Design goals:

All UI should be created dynamically with JavaScript based on clear business logic

Easy to read, maintain, and scale

Focus on user flow and logic, not just layout
